# Getting and Cleaning Data - a JHU Coursera course

## About run_analysis.R
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. I will be graded by my peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 

The following steps are done to build the run_analysis.R script:
Step 1. Load library needed for the project and download the Dataset.zip to the working directory
Step 2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Step 3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Step 5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Step 6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Datasets
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
